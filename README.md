# GeoAR Datasources

This repository provides a collection of data sources for the geolocation-based augmented reality browser GeoAR.

## Documentation

## Development

If you want to use these datasources, you have to build them manually and install them into your Maven local repository so that the dependencies can be resolved (git clone, then ``mvn clean install``). Then you can add a datasource as a dependencies in the geoar-app project.
